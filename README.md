About This Repository

This repository contains Python code inspired by examples from GeekforGeeks.org. It demonstrates the application of Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) for breast cancer classification using the scikit-learn library. GaussianNB is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks, particularly when dealing with continuous data.

Key Features:

Importing and organizing the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn's sample datasets.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Training a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.
Making predictions on test data and calculating accuracy.
Demonstrating the use of the trained model for classifying new data as cancerous or non-cancerous.
This code serves as an educational example for those interested in machine learning and classification tasks. The initial inspiration for this project came from code examples on GeekforGeeks.org. Feel free to explore the code, run it, and adapt it for your own projects. Contributions and improvements are welcome.

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries if not already installed (scikit-learn).
Run the Python script to see the classification results and how GaussianNB works in this context.
Please note that this example uses a simplified dataset for demonstration purposes. In practice, more extensive data preprocessing and model evaluation would be necessary for robust cancer classification.
